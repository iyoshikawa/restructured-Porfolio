                            While I am attending school, I was craving a means to gain enterprise experience. I submitted an application to NASA to push my limits of my knowledge and skills that I have been honing outside of classes. Upon my acceptance I was just a simple Front-end Developer, but now I am currently working on a few major Web Development projects that are utilizing Virtual Reality, Full Stack Angular Development and SharePoint with AngularJS aspects to support customer needs.

                                After working in IT I decided to pursue a serious career within Information Technology and fell in love with Software Development. I wanted to create tools that the National Guard made inhouse. All the software in use was never user friendly or aesthetically pleasing. With a Bachelors degree already completed I have been able to focus solely on programming languages and development lifecycle theory.
